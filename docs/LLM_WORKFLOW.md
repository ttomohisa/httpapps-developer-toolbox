# LLM Workflow

## Recommended request

Give the coding LLM the repository and this instruction:

> Read `AGENTS.md` first, then `APP_SPEC.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Inspect `components/` before recreating common UI such as confirmation dialogs or smartphone bottom action bars. Implement the complete application described by the spec. Preserve the single-HTML, local-first, no-runtime-network constraints. Update source, configuration, notices, README files, changelog, and tests as needed. Build and verify the repository before reporting completion. Do not edit either generated file in `dist/` by hand.

## Recommended development loop

1. Rewrite `APP_SPEC.md` with the concrete product.
2. Inspect `components/` and reuse generic source snippets where they fit.
3. Update `app.config.json`.
4. Ask the LLM to inspect the existing source before replacing the sample.
5. Let the LLM add exact dependencies only when justified.
6. Require the LLM to build after each meaningful implementation phase.
7. Review `dist/dependency-manifest.json` for unexpected packages or assets.
8. Open both generated HTML variants directly and test the core flow.
9. Publish only after the no-network check passes.

## Information that improves LLM output

Provide concrete details instead of style adjectives:

- Input examples and maximum sizes.
- Exact output format and filename rules.
- Destructive actions and undo behavior.
- Smartphone gestures and scroll behavior.
- Empty, loading, success, and error states.
- Data persistence and reset rules.
- Accessibility requirements.
- Browser and device targets.
- Visual references or screenshots when appearance matters.

## What the LLM should not do

- Replace the app with a framework that needs a runtime server.
- Add a CDN link “temporarily.”
- Add analytics, remote fonts, tracking pixels, or silent update checks.
- Claim complete offline behavior while a worker, WASM file, font, or dictionary remains external.
- Paste third-party minified source into the template.
- hide missing functionality behind non-working buttons.
- modify generated files in `dist/` instead of source.

## Review checkpoints

Ask for a review at these natural boundaries:

- Product state model is implemented.
- Main interaction is working on desktop.
- Touch and narrow-screen behavior is working.
- Export/import behavior is working.
- Dependencies and licenses are final.
- Build and no-network verification pass.
